# Wordle Solutions Discord Bot (On Hiatus)

⚠ DUE TO THE API NO LONGER WORKING, AND NO POSSIBLE WAY TO PREDICT WORDLE SOLUTIONS AFTER THE NYT DOMAIN CHANGE, THE BOT IS NO LONGER USABLE. ⚠

Wordle Solutions Discord Bot is a bot that used to post yesterday's Wordle solution. Wordle generates a new word every midnight, however, this depends on the local timezone. For example, people in Australia can get the new Wordle before people in the US.

This repo contains the code for the bot to run. It has been written using `nextcord.py` and uses an API provided by [Martin Najemi](https://najemi.cz/) ([API Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/wordlegame/comments/siw7oa/answers_api/)). The bot is hosted using Heroku.
